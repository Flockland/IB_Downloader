## Installation

### For Technical Users:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Flockland/IB_Downloader.git

    On **Windows**, run the `activate_venv.bat` script:
    ```bash
    activate_venv.bat
    ```

    This will activate the `venv` folder and set up the environment for your project.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
